# JavaScript.Avalonia

JavaScript.Avalonia provides reusable helpers that host a Jint JavaScript engine inside an Avalonia `TopLevel`. It exposes browser-like features such as `window`, `console`, `setTimeout`, and `requestAnimationFrame`, making it easier to integrate JavaScript-driven behaviours into Avalonia applications.

This package was extracted from the HtmlML project and is intended to be extended by higher level frameworks.
